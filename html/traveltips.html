         <h2>1. Book Early</h2>
         <p>  Some business trips come up at the last minute, 
         so it’s not always possible to book early. However, the earlier you book,
         the cheaper the costs will be and the more choice you will have. 
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>2. Review the travel policy </h2>
         <p> Spend 15 minutes and read the travel policy. 
         You’ll get a thorough understanding of the businesses expectations, 
         and if you think it needs updating, let the Travel Manager know. 
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>3. Plan your trip </h2>
         <p> Once you’ve booked flights, accommodation, cars 
         and other services, any changes can be expensive. 
         Take the time to plan what you need before launching into the booking phase.
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>4. Make the most of time </h2>
         <p> If you’re travelling and you’ve only got one meeting, 
         try and incorporate other business related activities into your trip. 
         Can you see other clients? Can you visit potential new clients? 
         Can you add another leg onto the journey to get more business done?
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>5. Use travel management tool</h2>
         <p> Online travel management tools can save 
         time and money for businesses and employees alike. 
         It ensures preferred suppliers are used, 
         approvals are given where necessary, communication 
         is streamlined, expenses are captured, and reports are easily created. 
         It’s the easiest way to ensure travel policy compliance.
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>6. Ask the Travel Manager for some travel perks </h2>
         <p>  Airlines, hotels, car hire companies
          and other travel service providers often give 
          companies perks to become their preferred supplier. 
          These include frequent flyer miles and free hotel stays, 
          so if you travel a lot for your company, ask the Travel Manager 
          if they can give you some as a bonus for your next holiday.
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2> 7. Sign up for loyalty programs  </h2>
         <p>You’d be amazed at the potential perks you could enjoy just by signing up to hotel, airline and other loyalty programs. You don’t really have to do anything, but when you ask for an upgrade at the check-in desk, being a member might just get you a positive response. Other possible benefits could include free breakfasts, late checkouts, and a bottle of wine waiting for you on your bed when you arrive!
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>8. Be prepared of all the outcomes </h2>
         <p> Make sure your phone has every phone number 
         you could possibly need while on the road. 
         Need to contact someone at the office straight away? 
         Make sure you’ve got their number. 
         Need to find the car service you’ve booked because they’re MIA? 
         Make sure you’ve got their number. Need the hotel to 
         do something for you at short notice? Make sure you’ve
          got their number. You get the drift…
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>9. Download apps </h2>
         <p> Before you leave the hotel, check the airline app to see if
          your flight has been delayed or the boarding gate has changed. 
          Better to be stuck in your hotel room for a few hours than at the airport.
          Its good to have multiple applications and checking websites.
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>10. Leave a detailed schedule </h2>
         <p> This rule applies for any travelling you do. 
         To ensure family and colleagues know where you should be at
         all times, leave a detailed schedule with them. 
         That way if anything goes wrong they can contact you immediately.
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>11. Check your travel insurance</h2>
         <p>You should never travel without insurance because
          anything can happen. You might get sick, luggage might
          get lost, or any one of thousands of other things might 
          happen that could end up costing a lot of money. Check 
          your travel insurance policy and make sure you’re covered 
          for where you’re going and what you’ll be doing.
         </p>
         </div>

         <div class="grid_4">
         <h2>12. Prepare to minimise jet lag</h2>
         <p> Business trips are usually on a tight schedule, so the last thing you want to do is arrive at your destination unable to do your work because you’ve got a bad case of jet lag. Drink plenty of water, avoid alcohol and coffee, and get enough sleep on your flight so you’re fresh when you land. This could be one of those times when spending a little extra on a business class seat will be more than made up for in greater productivity.
